# Fake users Detection 

This project is focused on detecting fake users using various machine learning models while addressing overfitting issues through regularization, model complexity control, and cross-validation.

## Project Structure

- **notebook.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook that includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation with techniques to control overfitting.
- **README.md**: Documentation and instructions for running the project.

## Project Overview

Fake users  detection has become a crucial area in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. This project aims to classify twitter users  as real or fake using a variety of machine learning models. Given the potential for models to overfit, especially in complex tasks like text classification, several strategies are implemented to enhance generalization.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - **Text Vectorization**: Converts text descriptions into numerical features using TF-IDF.
  - **Categorical Encoding**: Uses One-Hot Encoding to convert categorical features.
  - **Feature Scaling**: Standardizes numerical features for balanced model performance.

- **Overfitting Control**:
  - **Regularization**: Adds regularization terms in models like Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines.
  - **Complexity Control**: Limits tree depth in models like Random Forest and Decision Tree to avoid capturing noise.
  - **Cross-Validation**: Uses Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation to assess the generalization of each model.

- **Model Training and Evaluation**:
  - Six models are compared: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree.
  - Each model is evaluated on accuracy to gain insights into performance.
